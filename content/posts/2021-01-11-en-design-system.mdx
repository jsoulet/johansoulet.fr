A highly efficient product offers its users a consistent experience throught the various entry points they can have with the brand (mobile and web apps, emails, landing pages, social networks...)

Therefore, a design system is a strong asset to communicate effectively with its audience and help the teams to create content effectively. Also, because it defines various rules and usages, it empowers them by giving more freedom.

For instance, let's imagine two engineering teams working on the same project. They're more likely to create a unified user journey if they agree on using common constants, components, page architecture principles.

## What can we found in a design system ?

- A **graphic charter** where (colors, spacings, shadows...)
- a **UI kit** that designers use to create mockups
- one or many **component librairies** depending on the target plateforms and development frameworks (iOS, Android, React...)
- A development and architecture **documentation** to be able to use the component properly
- A **contribution guide**, because a design system is a living thing and should be able to accept contributions from users on the field

A design system is a service which the users are the content creator in your company, and not a static asset (ex: Figma components, Storybook), that's why it is recommended to dedicate a team in charge of maintaining it. As it is at the crossroads of several jobs, you should pay attention to have a multidisciplinary team.

Some companies made their UI kits and component libraries public so it can help you to figure out how it would look like by the end.

Don't forget that those links are only showing the tip of the iceberg : as I wrote a before, a design system is a living product and the websites are not showing the teams in charge, the contribution process...

If you want to dig deeper into design system creation and support, I reccomend you this interview of Cl√©ment Menant, UX design in charge of Airbus design system, who used to work at [Troopers](https://troopers.agency) before I joined the team.
