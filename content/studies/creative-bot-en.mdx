### Project details

Creative Bot is a web app to connect sport leagues to their fan bases thanks to messaging platforms: Facebook, Whatsapp, SMS...

They had a forst MVP and I got involved into the project to help this young startup to develop key features and win new markets. During the development, I also played an architect role to advise the team to create modular bricks and a mre uniform app code base. I reviewed the file tree, setup a unit test framework and modernize tools and internal librairies to build a stronger developer experience.

#### Highlights

- UI to create chat bots
- Real time chat interface
- Dynamic conversation filter management
- Update and standardize the technical stack
- Setup a test strategy
