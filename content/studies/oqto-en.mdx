### Project details

Oqto is a digital plateform to help managers engaging their teams and make their career path evolve in the best way for everyone.

After a first beta, Oqto needed to accelerate its development and get its first paid users. I've been hired to support the technical team and develop the "Teams" feature. My expertise in React, Typescript and Redux has been usefull to suggest efficient coding paradigms that improve user experience (Optimistic UI)

#### Highlights


- Team management UI
- React, Typescript, Redux
- Optimistic UI
