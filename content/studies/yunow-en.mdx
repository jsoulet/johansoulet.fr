### Project details

Yunow is a platform to create touch apps for professionals from tourism, culture, education. They are used by more than 200 establishments in France and Europe.

During cultural sites re-opening after the Covid-19 shutdown, the places don't have enough resources to respect sanitary measures to maintain the audio-guides loan. I've been missioned to develop specific features to create digital audio guides that can be customized through Yunow's platform,

#### Highlights

- Restricted access screen
- Search and quick access to cards
- New presentation layout for artworks
